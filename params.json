This allows the browser to match an image to the screen properties, producing a responsive image.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is limited to screen width. The next version will include screen resolution, once I work out the most practical way to do this cross-browser.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn your HTML img element, add a src attribute as follows:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t<img src=\"kangaroo.jpg\" srcset=\"kangaroo.jpg, wombat.jpg 400w, emu.jpg 800w\">\r\n```\r\nIn principal, supporting browsers should ignore the original src attribute, which is repeated in the srcset attribute. The additional images are followed by their minimum screen width requirment.\r\n\r\nFor your JavaScript add something like the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"srcset.js\"></script>\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n\t\tif(window.addEventListener) window.addEventListener('load',init',false);\r\n\t\telse window.attachEvent('onload',init');\t//\tLegacy browsers; srcset won’t work anyway\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction init() {\r\n\t\t\tdoSrcset();\r\n\t\t\t//\tetc\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should do the job.\r\n\r\nSample\r\n------\r\n\r\n[Sample](sample/srcset.html)\r\n\r\nChange the screen width and see the different images replace the curren ones. If you use Firefox’s responsive design tool, it’s just a matter of dragging the edge of the container.\r\n\r\nBrowser Support\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nEventually this widget won’t be necessary. Currently it tests whether srcset support is natively implemented and exits if so.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it supports all browsers which support the JavaScript matchMedia() method. This means all modern browsers, as well as IE10+.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the browsers which most need responsive images, that is, the ones on mobile devices, are supported. However, for the rare device which hase IE8 or IE9, it doesn’t work.\r\n\r\nPossible Enhancements\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n1.\tSupport for screen resolutions.\r\n\r\n2. Support for IE8 & IE9.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\n\r\nUsual stuff:\r\n\r\n* This product does what it does and doesn’t do what it doesn‘t do.\r\n* It probably won’t break anything, but if it does, it’s all lies I tell you, it wasn’t me, it was someone who looks like me, I’ve never heard of the place, I don’t know what you’re talking about, and, if you’re talking about Room 403, I’ve never heard if it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
